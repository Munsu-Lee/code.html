      <p>The Fender Stratocaster, colloquially known as the Strat, is a model of electric guitar <br>
        designed from 1952 into 1954 by Leo Fender, Bill Carson, George Fullerton and Freddie Tavares.<br>
        The Fender Musical Instruments Corporation has continuously manufactured the Stratocaster since 1954. <br>
        It is a double-cutaway guitar, with an extended top "horn" shape for balance. Along with the Gibson <br>
        Les Paul, Gibson SG and Fender Telecaster, it is one of the most-often emulated electric guitar shapes.<br>
        "Stratocaster" and "Strat" are trademark terms belonging to Fender. Guitars that duplicate the Stratocaster<br>
         by other manufacturers are sometimes called S-Type or ST-type guitars.</p>

        <p style = "margin-top : 60px;">The guitar introduced into the popular market several features that were innovative <br>
          for electric guitars in the mid 1950s. The distinctive body shape, which has become commonplace <br>
          among electric guitars, was revolutionary for the time period, and for the first time a mass-market<br>
          electric guitar did not significantly resemble earlier acoustic models. The double cutaway,<br>
          elongated horns, and heavily contoured back were all designed for better balance and comfort <br>
          to play while standing up and slung off the shoulder with a strap. The three-pickup design offered<br>
          players increased versatility and choice in tone quality over earlier one- and two-pickup electric guitars, <br>
          and a responsive and simplified vibrato arm integrated into the bridge plate, which marked a significant<br>
          design improvement over other vibrato systems, such as those manufactured by Bigsby. All of these design <br>
          elements were popularized and later became an industry standard due to the success of the Stratocaster.</p>
