          <p>The Gibson Les Paul is a solid body electric guitar that was first sold by the Gibson <br>
            Guitar Corporation in 1952.[1] The guitar was designed by factory manager John Huis and <br>
            his team with input from and endorsement by guitarist Les Paul. Its typical design features <br>
            a solid mahogany body with a carved maple top and a single cutaway, a mahogany set-in neck with <br>
            a rosewood fretboard, two pickups with independent volume and tone controls, and a stoptail <br>
            bridge, although variants exist.</p>

          The Les Paul was originally offered with a gold finish and two P-90 pickups. In 1957, humbucking<br>
          pickups were added, along with sunburst finishes in 1958. The 1958â€“1960 sunburst Les Paul, today<br>
          one of the best-known electric guitar types in the world, was considered a commercial failure,<br>
          [citation needed] with low production and sales. For 1961, the Les Paul was redesigned into what<br>
          is now known as the Gibson SG. The original single-cutaway, carved top bodystyle was re-introduced<br>
          in 1968. The Les Paul has been produced in many versions and editions since. Along with Fender's Telecaster <br>
          and Stratocaster, it was one of the first mass-produced electric solid-body guitars. Due to their versatility, <br>
          Les Paul electric guitars have been used in a wide range of music genres, including rock, country, pop, soul,<br>
          rhythm and blues, blues, jazz, reggae, punk, and heavy metal.</p>
