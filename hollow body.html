          <p>A semi-acoustic guitar, hollow-body electric, or thinline is a type of electric<br>
             guitar that was first created in the 1930s. It has a sound box and at least one<br>
             electric pickup. The semi-acoustic guitar is different to an acoustic-electric guitar,<br>
             which is an acoustic guitar with the addition of pickups or other means of amplification,<br>
             added by either the manufacturer or the player.</p>

          The semi-acoustic and semi-hollow body guitars were used widely throughout the jazz communities<br>
          in the 1930s.The guitars began to make their way into popular music as new models and sleeker<br>
          designs emerged. The guitar became used in pop, folk, and blues. The guitars sometimes produced<br>
          feedback when played through an amplifier at a loud level so they were unpopular for bands that had<br>
          to play loud enough to perform in large venues. As rock became more experimental in the late 60s and 70s,<br>
          the guitar became more popular because players learned to use its feedback issues creatively; One example <br>
          is Ted Nugent, who primarily plays the semi-acoustic Gibson Byrdland.</p>
