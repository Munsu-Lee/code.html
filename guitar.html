      <p>The types of electric guitars are many since it is undoubtedly the most popular instrument. <br>
        So many people identify with its sound, a sound that gives a voice to those who want to communicate <br>
        through emotion instead of words.</p>

        <p style = "margin-top : 40px;">Two brands are synonymous with this type of instrument: <strong>Gibson and Fender.</strong> <br>
          Not only were they the earliest to bring the electric guitar to the masses, but the guitar <br>
          body styles and designs they created are still employed today, preferred by budding beginners<br>
          and working professional musicians alike.</p>
